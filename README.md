So to deal with this kind of issues Today we will be preparing a MACHINE LEARNING Based model, trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset. 

Importing Libraries and Dataset
Here we are using 

Pandas – To load the Dataframe
Matplotlib – To visualize the data features i.e. barplot
Seaborn – To see the correlation between features using heatmap
